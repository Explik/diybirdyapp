## Exercise content
This section describes the components of an exercise. 
It first describes the overall relationship between exercises, exercise answers, and exercise sessions. 
Then it describes the different available exercise contents and inputs. 

Documentation for each of specific exercise type is provided in exercise-types.md.

### Exercise, ExerciseAnswer, ExerciseSession
This section describes the overall relationship between exercises, exercise answers, and exercise sessions.
```mermaid
graph TB

Exercise--hasSession-->ExerciseSession
ExerciseAnswer--hasSession-->ExerciseSession
ExerciseAnswer--hasExercise-->ExerciseSession
```

Exercise properties:
- id: string
- type: string

Exercise answer properties:
- id: string

Exercise session properties:
- id: string

### Exercise with Audio/Image/Text/Video Content
```mermaid 
graph TB
Exercise(Exercise)
AnyContent(<T> Content)

Exercise--hasContent-->AnyContent
```

Exercise can by default have any basic content type. 
However, some exercise types may restrict the allowed content types.

### Exercise with Flashcard (Side) Content 
```mermaid
graph TB
Exercise(Exercise)
Flashcard(Flashcard)

Exercise--hasContent-->Flashcard
```

The flashcard content can exist in two forms: 
- A regular flashcard (two-sided) is indicated by the hasContent edge (without any flashcardSide attribute).
- A flashcard side (one-sided) is indicated by the flashcardSide property on the hasContent edge.

### Exercise with Select Options Input
This section describes the graph representation for the select-option input.

```mermaid
graph TB
Exercise(Exercise)
ExerciseAnswer(ExerciseAnswer)
AnyContent1(<T> Content)
AnyContent2(<T> Content)
AnyContent3(<T> Content)
AnyContent4(<T> Content)

Exercise--hasCorrectOption-->AnyContent1
Exercise--hasCorrectOption-->AnyContent2
Exercise--hasOption-->AnyContent3
Exercise--hasIncorrectOption-->AnyContent4
Exercise--hasAnswer-->ExerciseAnswer
ExerciseAnswer--hasSelectedOption-->AnyContent1
```
The allowed option types are: 
- AudioContent
- TextContent
- ImageContent

All options must be of the same type. Each option can either be correct, incorrect and undecided (indicated by hasOption). 

### Exercise with Recognizability Rating Input
This section describes the graph representation for the recognizability rating input.
```mermaid
graph TB
Exercise(Exercise)
ExerciseAnswer(ExerciseAnswer)
RecognizabilityRating(RecognizabilityRating)
```

The available ratings are stored in code and are not represented in the graph.
The selected rating is stored in the RecognizabilityRating vertex.

### Exercise with Write Text Input
This section describes the graph representation for the write text input.
```mermaid
graph TB
Exercise(Exercise)
ExerciseAnswer(ExerciseAnswer)
TextContent1(TextContent)
TextContent2(TextContent)
TextContent3(TextContent)

Exercise--hasCorrectOption-->TextContent1
Exercise--hasIncorrectOption-->TextContent2
Exercise--hasAnswer-->ExerciseAnswer
ExerciseAnswer--hasContent-->TextContent3
```
The correct option(s) represents a clearly correct answer to the exercise. \
The incorrect option(s) represents a clearly incorrect answer to the exercise. \
The actual answer will be stored in the ExerciseAnswer vertex.

NB, it is possible for an exercise to have no correct or incorrect options.
